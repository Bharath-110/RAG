## Overview

RAG pipelines combine the power of large language models with information retrieval systems to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This project aims to make RAG technology accessible to everyone by providing implementations that can run efficiently on CPU-only environments.

## Features

- Multiple RAG pipeline implementations
- CPU-friendly architectures
- Extensible design for custom data sources


## Requirements
To Run locally
- Python 3.9+
- Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook extension
- 16 GB RAM (minimum)
- 20GB free disk space

Or 
Can run on Google Colab

## Installation
